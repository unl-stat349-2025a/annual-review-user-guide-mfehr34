# Needs Assessment {.appendix}

The main audience for this user guide is someone looking to import data into R and perform a basic data cleaning to prepare semi-messy data for analysis. Some problems with their messy data may be duplicate values, missing values, and incorrect data types.

Some parts that I anticipate might be challenging are:

- Downloading R and RStudio (if needed)
- Importing data into R
- Imputing missing values (or dropping rows with null values)
- Converting columns from one data type to another
