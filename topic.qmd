# Topic

My article discusses data analysis as a major part of the Data Science Process. In particular, it references data cleaning numerous times and the steps that are involved in a simple data cleaning: load data from a csv, drop rows with null values, and converting text into numeric values.

The article uses R to describe this process, so my user guide will be simple data cleaning in R. The packages I will use are dplyr and tidyr. I have never actually done data cleaning in R (only in Python), so it will be a learning experience for myself, as well. I may add more steps/packages as I go.
